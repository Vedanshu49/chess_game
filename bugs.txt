Chess Application Development Plan: Bug Fixes & Feature Roadmap
This document outlines the required bug fixes, user experience enhancements, and new features for the chess application. Tasks are categorized by priority and area of focus.

## üëë High Priority: Core Functionality & Stability
### 1. Fix Critical User Login Failures
Issue: Login fails intermittently (75% failure rate) in a normal browser but works more reliably in incognito mode (25% failure rate). This points to issues with client-side caching and server-side session management.

Action: Implement a robust solution by following the detailed troubleshooting guide below to diagnose and fix the root cause related to stale cookies, cache, and session data.

Implementation Guide:

Diagnosis:

Use Browser DevTools: Open the 'Network' and 'Application' tabs.

Compare Requests: Record and compare the full request/response headers (especially Cookie, Set-Cookie, Cache-Control) of a failed login in a normal browser versus a successful login in incognito.

Confirm the Cause: Manually clear all site data (cache, cookies) in the normal browser. A successful login immediately after will confirm that stale client-side data is the culprit.

Server-Side Fixes (Node.js/Express):

Robust Session Handling:

On logout, properly destroy the session: req.session.destroy().

On successful login, regenerate the session to create a fresh one: req.session.regenerate().

Disable Caching on Auth Routes: Create a middleware to set Cache-Control: no-store headers on /login, /logout, and other sensitive API endpoints.

Secure Cookie Configuration: Set secure defaults in express-session: { httpOnly: true, secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production', sameSite: 'Lax' }.

Client-Side Fixes:

Explicit Cleanup: On logout, ensure the client-side code explicitly removes any stored tokens or user data from localStorage and sessionStorage.

### 2. Resolve Website Freeze on Page Refresh
Issue: Refreshing the page causes the website to freeze on a loading spinner, forcing the user to close the tab and log in again.

Action: Improve session and state management. The application must gracefully handle a page refresh by either seamlessly reconnecting to the game state or returning the user to a stable dashboard without freezing.

### 3. Repair Online Matchmaking Functionality
Issue: The matchmaking feature is broken. It produces a SQL error (Could not find the function public.matchmake_or_create_game) and fails to match the only two active players on the site.

Action:

Database: Debug the PostgreSQL function matchmake_or_create_game to ensure it exists, has the correct permissions, and its logic is sound.

Backend Logic: Review the matchmaking algorithm. It should correctly identify waiting players and pair them in a game.

## ‚ôüÔ∏è In-Game Logic & Rules Engine
### 1. Implement Pawn Promotion
Issue: Pawns that reach the final rank are not being promoted.

Action: When a pawn reaches the opponent's back rank, a UI modal must appear, allowing the player to choose between a Queen, Rook, Bishop, or Knight. The game state must update with the selected piece.

### 2. Implement Stalemate and End-of-Game Logic
Issue: The game does not end when a player has no legal moves (stalemate).

Action: After every move, the game engine must check if the current player is in checkmate or stalemate. If a stalemate or checkmate condition is met, end the game and declare the appropriate winner or a draw.

### 3. Correct Chessboard Dimensions
Issue: The chessboard is not rendering as a standard 8x8 grid in all game modes.

Action: Ensure the board rendering component consistently generates an 8x8 grid and that all game logic correctly references a 64-square model.

## ‚ú® User Experience (UX) & Interface (UI)
### 1. Enhance Piece Movement Controls
Issue: The only way to move pieces is via drag-and-drop. This is not ideal for all devices.

Action: Implement an additional Click-and-Click (or Tap-and-Tap) movement system.

First Click: Selects the piece and highlights its legal moves.

Second Click: Moves the piece to a highlighted legal square. Clicking a non-legal square or the same piece again should deselect it.

### 2. Improve Error Messaging
Issue: Invalid moves show a generic "unexpected error" popup. Users need clearer feedback.

Action: Implement context-specific error messages.

Instead of "unexpected error," show "Invalid Move."

Add more specific errors like: "You cannot place your King in check," "This piece is blocked," or "You cannot capture your own piece."

### 3. Fix Duplicate Error Popups
Issue: Two error popups appear simultaneously (one from the top, one from the bottom).

Action: Refactor the global notification system to ensure that only one error popup appears from the top for any given error, across the entire website.

### 4. Correct Game Timer Logic
Issue: The game timer starts as soon as one player joins, even before the opponent has arrived.

Action: The timer should only begin its countdown after both players have joined the game and the first move is ready to be made.

### 5. Fix "Waiting for Opponent" Screen
Issue: The "Waiting for opponent" message does not disappear after the opponent joins.

Action: Ensure the UI state correctly updates and removes the waiting message as soon as the second player connects to the game session.

## üöÄ Performance
### 1. Smooth Out Piece Movement Animation
Issue: Moving pieces feels "jittery and laggy" in all game modes.

Action: Optimize the piece animation logic. Use CSS transforms (translate) for movement instead of manipulating top/left properties. Ensure the drag-and-drop or click-and-move logic is efficient and does not cause re-renders of the entire board on every pixel of movement.
